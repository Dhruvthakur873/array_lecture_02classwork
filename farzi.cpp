// Q2 - ​There is a man going on a trek. The trek consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The
// man starts his trek on point 0 with altitude equal 0. You are given an integer array height
// of length n where height[i] is the net height in altitude between points i​ and i + 1 for all
// (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.



// Q3 - ​Given an integer array arr consisting of 0’s and 1’s only, return the max length of
// sequence which contains equal numbers of 0 and 1.

// Q4 - ​Given an integer array arr, return the number of consecutive sequences(subarrays) with
// odd sum.
// Q5 - Given an integer array arr, return an array ans such that ans[i] is equal to the product of
// all the elements of arr except arr[i].

// Q6 - ​Given an array of size ‘n’ (initially zero) and ‘q’ number of updates where in each update
// we can increase the value of all index from index l to index r with value x and in the end
// print all the numbers of the array.
